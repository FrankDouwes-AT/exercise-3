/*
The reason to turn this into a service is to have all API logic in 1 place,
it's very tempting (and also inline with "component based" thinking) to let each component do its own data fetching,
but the result is scattered API logic (which is generally at the core of the app),
having it all in one place helps with debugging & maintainability of large codebases.
